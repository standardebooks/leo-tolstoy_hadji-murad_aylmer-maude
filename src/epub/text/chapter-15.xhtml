			<p>The report was dispatched from Tiflis on the 24th of December 1851, and on New Year’s Eve a courier, having overdriven a dozen horses and beaten a dozen drivers till the blood came, delivered it to Prince Chernyshóv, who at that time was Minister of War; and on the 1st of January 1852 Chernyshóv, among other papers, took Vorontsóv’s report to the Emperor Nicholas.</p>
			<p>Chernyshóv disliked Vorontsóv because of the general respect in which the latter was held, and because of his immense wealth; and also because Vorontsóv was a real aristocrat, while Chernyshóv, after all, was a parvenu; but especially because the Emperor was particularly well disposed towards Vorontsóv. Therefore at every opportunity Chernyshóv tried to injure Vorontsóv.</p>
			<p>When he had last presented the report about Caucasian affairs, he had succeeded in arousing Nicholas’s displeasure against Vorontsóv because⁠—through the carelessness of those in command⁠—almost the whole of a small Caucasian detachment had been destroyed by the mountaineers. He now intended to present the steps taken by Vorontsóv in relation to Hadji Murád in an unfavorable light. He wished to suggest to the Emperor that Vorontsóv always protected and even indulged the natives, to the detriment of the Russians, and that he had acted unwisely in allowing Hadji Murád to remain in the Caucasus, for there was every reason to suspect that he had only come over to spy on our means of defense; and that it would therefore be better to transport him to Central Russia, and make use of him only after his family had been rescued from the mountaineers and it had become possible to convince ourselves of his loyalty.</p>
			<p>Chernyshóv’s plan did not succeed, merely because on that New Year’s Day Nicholas was in particularly bad spirits, and out of perversity would not have accepted any suggestion whatever from anyone, least of all from Chernyshóv, whom he only tolerated⁠—regarding him as indispensable for the time being, but looking upon him as a blackguard; for Nicholas knew of his endeavors at the trial of the Decembrists<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-32" id="noteref-32" epub:type="noteref">32</a> to secure the conviction of Zachary Chernyshóv and of his attempt to obtain Zachary’s property for himself. So, thanks to Nicholas’s ill temper, Hadji Murád remained in the Caucasus; and his circumstances were not changed as they might have been had Chernyshóv presented his report at another time.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>It was half-past nine o’clock when, through the mist of the cold morning (the thermometer showed 13 degrees below zero Fahrenheit) Chernyshóv’s fat, bearded coachman, sitting on the box of a small sledge (like the one Nicholas drove about in) with a sharp-angled, cushion-shaped azure velvet cap on his head, drew up at the entrance of the Winter Palace, and gave a friendly nod to his chum, Prince Dolgorúky’s coachman⁠—who, having brought his master to the palace, had himself long been waiting outside, in his big coat with the thickly wadded skirts, sitting on the reins and rubbing his numbed hands together. Chernyshóv had on a long, large-caped cloak, with a fluffy collar of silver beaver, and a regulation three-cornered hat with cocks’ feathers. He threw back the bearskin apron of the sledge, and carefully disengaged his chilled feet, on which he had no goloshes (he prided himself on never wearing any). Clanking his spurs with an air of bravado, he ascended the carpeted steps and passed through the hall door, which was respectfully opened for him by the porter, and entered the hall. Having thrown off his cloak, which an old Court lackey hurried forward to take, he went to a mirror and carefully removed the hat from his curled wig. Looking at himself in the mirror, he arranged the hair on his temples and the tuft above his forehead with an accustomed movement of his old hands, and adjusted his cross, the shoulder-knots of his uniform, and his large-initialled epaulets; and then went up the gently-ascending carpeted stairs, his not very reliable old legs feebly mounting the shallow steps. Passing the Court lackeys in gala livery, who stood obsequiously bowing, Chernyshóv entered the waiting-room. A newly appointed aide-de-camp to the Emperor, in a shining new uniform, with epaulets and shoulder-knots and a still fresh rosy face, a small black mustache, and the hair on his temples brushed towards his eyes (Nicholas’s fashion) met him respectfully.</p>
			<p>Prince Vasíly Dolgorúky, Assistant-Minister of War, with an expression of ennui on his dull face⁠—which was ornamented with similar whiskers, mustaches, and temple tufts brushed forward like Nicholas’s⁠—greeted him.</p>
			<p>“<i xml:lang="fr">L’empereur?</i>” said Chernyshóv, addressing the aide-de-camp and looking inquiringly towards the door leading to the cabinet.</p>
			<p>“<i xml:lang="fr">Sa majesté vient de rentrer</i>,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-33" id="noteref-33" epub:type="noteref">33</a> replied the aide-de-camp, evidently enjoying the sound of his own voice, and, stepping so softly and steadily that had a tumbler of water been placed on his head none of it would have been spilt, he approached the noislessly opening door and, his whole body evincing reverence for the spot he was about to visit, disappeared.</p>
			<p>Dolgorúky meanwhile opened his portfolio to see that it contained the necessary papers, while Chernyshóv, frowning, paced up and down to restore the circulation in his numbed feet, and thought over what he was about to report to the Emperor. He was near the door of the cabinet when it opened again, and the aide-de-camp, even more radiant and respectful than before, came out and with a gesture invited the minister and his assistant to enter.</p>
			<p>The Winter Palace had been rebuilt after a fire some considerable time before this, but Nicholas was still occupying rooms in the upper story. The cabinet in which he received the reports of his ministers and other high officials was a very lofty apartment with four large windows. A big portrait of the Emperor Alexander <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> hung on the front wall. Between the windows stood two bureaux. By the walls stood several chairs. In the middle of the room was an enormous writing table, with an armchair before it for Nicholas, and other chairs for those to whom he gave audience.</p>
			<p>Nicholas sat at the table in a black coat with shoulder-straps but no epaulets, his enormous body⁠—with his overgrown stomach tightly laced in⁠—was thrown back, and he gazed at the newcomers with fixed, lifeless eyes. His long, pale face, with its enormous receding forehead between the tufts of hair which were brushed forward and skillfully joined to the wig that covered his bald patch, was specially cold and stony that day. His eyes, always dim, looked duller than usual; the compressed lips under his upturned mustaches, and his fat freshly shaven cheeks⁠—on which symmetrical sausage-shaped bits of whiskers had been left⁠—supported by the high collar, and his chin which also pressed upon it, gave his face a dissatisfied and even irate expression. The cause of the bad mood he was in was fatigue. The fatigue was due to the fact that he had been to a masquerade the night before, and while walking about as was his wont, in his Horse Guards’ uniform with a bird on the helmet, among the public which crowded round and timidly made way for his enormous, self-assured figure, he again met the mask who at the previous masquerade, by her whiteness, her beautiful figure, and her tender voice had aroused his senile sensuality. She had then disappeared, after promising to meet him at the next masquerade.</p>
			<p>At yesterday’s masquerade she had come up to him, and he had not let her go again, but had led her to the box specially kept ready for that purpose, where he could be alone with her. Having arrived in silence at the door of the box, Nicholas looked round to find the attendant, but he was not there. Nicholas frowned, and pushed the door open himself, letting the lady enter first.</p>
			<p>“<i xml:lang="fr">Il y a quelqu’un!</i>”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-34" id="noteref-34" epub:type="noteref">34</a> said the mask, stopping short.</p>
			<p>The box actually was occupied. On the small velvet-covered sofa, close together, sat an Uhlan officer and a pretty, curly-haired, fair young woman in a domino, who had removed her mask. On catching sight of the angry figure of Nicholas, drawn up to its full height, the fair-haired woman quickly covered her face with her mask, but the Uhlan officer, rigid with fear, without rising from the sofa, gazed at Nicholas with fixed eyes.</p>
			<p>Used as he was to the terror he inspired in others, that terror always pleased Nicholas, and by way of contrast he sometimes liked to astound those plunged in terror by addressing kindly words to them. He did so on this occasion.</p>
			<p>“Well, friend!” said he to the officer, “You are younger than I, and might give up your place to me.”</p>
			<p>The officer jumped to his feet, and growing first pale and then red and bending almost double, he followed his partner silently out of the box, leaving Nicholas alone with his lady.</p>
			<p>She proved to be a pretty, twenty-year-old virgin, the daughter of a Swedish governess. She told Nicholas how, when quite a child, she had fallen in love with him from his portraits; how she adored him, and made up her mind to attract his attention at any cost. Now she had succeeded, and wanted nothing more⁠—so she said.</p>
			<p>The girl was taken to the place where Nicholas usually had rendezvous with women, and there he spent more than an hour with her.</p>
			<p>When he returned to his room that night and lay on the hard narrow bed about which he prided himself, and covered himself with the cloak which he considered to be (and spoke of as being) as famous as Napoleon’s hat, it was a long time before he could fall asleep. He thought now of the frightened and elated expression on that girl’s fair face, and now of the full, powerful shoulders of his established mistress, Nelídova, and he compared the two. That profligacy in a married man was a bad thing did not once enter his head; and he would have been greatly surprised had anyone censured him for it. Yet, though convinced that he had acted properly, some kind of unpleasant aftertaste remained behind, and to stifle that feeling he dwelt on a thought that always tranquilized him⁠—the thought of his own greatness.</p>
			<p>Though he fell asleep very late, he rose before eight, and after attending to his toilet in the usual way⁠—rubbing his big well-fed body all over with ice⁠—and saying his prayers (repeating those he had been used to from childhood⁠—the prayer to the Virgin, the Apostles’ Creed, and the Lord’s Prayer, without attaching any kind of meaning to the words he uttered), he went out through the smaller portico of the palace on to the embankment, in his military cloak and cap.</p>
			<p>On the embankment he met a student in the uniform of the School of Jurisprudence, who was as enormous as himself. On recognizing the uniform of that school, which he disliked for its freedom of thought, Nicholas frowned; but the stature of the student and the painstaking manner in which he drew himself up and saluted, ostentatiously sticking out his elbow, mollified Nicholas’s displeasure.</p>
			<p>“Your name?” said he.</p>
			<p>“Polosátov, your Imperial Majesty.”</p>
			<p>“… fine fellow!”</p>
			<p>The student continued to stand with his hand lifted to his hat.</p>
			<p>Nicholas stopped.</p>
			<p>“Do you wish to enter the army?”</p>
			<p>“Not at all, your Imperial Majesty.”</p>
			<p>“Blockhead!” And Nicholas turned away and continued his walk, and began uttering aloud the first words that came into his head.</p>
			<p>“Kopervine⁠ ⁠… Kopervine⁠—” he repeated several times (it was the name of yesterday’s girl). “Horrid⁠ ⁠… horrid⁠—” He did not think of what he said, but stifled his feelings by listening to it.</p>
			<p>“Yes, what would Russia do without me?” said he, feeling his former dissatisfaction returning; “yes, what would⁠—not Russia alone but Europe be, without me?” and calling to mind the weakness and stupidity of his brother-in-law, the King of Prussia, he shook his head.</p>
			<p>As he was returning to the small portico, he saw the carriage of Helena Pávlovna,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-35" id="noteref-35" epub:type="noteref">35</a> with a red-liveried footman, approaching the Saltykóv entrance of the palace.</p>
			<p>Helena Pávlovna was to him the personification of that futile class of people who discussed not merely science and poetry, but even the ways of governing men: imagining that they could govern themselves better than he, Nicholas, governed them! He knew that however much he crushed such people, they reappeared again and again, and he recalled his brother, Michael Pávlovich, who had died not long before. A feeling of sadness and vexation came over him, and with a dark frown he again began whispering the first words that came into his head. He only ceased doing this when he re-entered the palace.</p>
			<p>On reaching his apartments he smoothed his whiskers and the hair on his temples and the wig on his bald patch, and twisted his mustaches upwards in front of the mirror; and then went straight to the cabinet in which he received reports.</p>
			<p>He first received Chernyshóv, who at once saw by his face, and especially by his eyes, that Nicholas was in a particularly bad humor that day; and knowing about the adventure of the night before, he understood the cause. Having coldly greeted Chernyshóv and invited him to sit down, Nicholas fixed on him a lifeless gaze. The first matter Chernyshóv reported upon was a case, which had just been discovered, of embezzlement by commissariat officials; the next was the movement of troops on the Prussian frontier; then came a list of rewards to be given at the New Year to some people omitted from a former list; then Vorontsóv’s report about Hadji Murád; and lastly some unpleasant business concerning an attempt by a student of the Academy of Medicine on the life of a professor.</p>
			<p>Nicholas heard the report of the embezzlement silently, with compressed lips, his large white hand⁠—with one ring on the fourth finger⁠—stroking some sheets of paper, and his eyes steadily fixed on Chernyshóv’s forehead and on the tuft of hair above it.</p>
			<p>Nicholas was convinced that everybody stole. He knew he would have to punish the commissariat officials now, and decided to send them all to serve in the ranks; but he also knew that this would not prevent those who succeeded them from acting in the same way. It was a characteristic of officials to steal, but it was his duty to punish them for doing so; and tired as he was of that duty he conscientiously performed it.</p>
			<p>“It seems there is only one honest man in Russia!” said he.</p>
			<p>Chernyshóv at once understood that this one honest man was Nicholas himself, and smiled approvingly.</p>
			<p>“It looks like it, your Imperial Majesty,” said he.</p>
			<p>“Leave it⁠—I will give a decision,” said Nicholas, taking the document and putting it on the left side of the table.</p>
			<p>Then Chernyshóv reported the rewards to be given, and about moving the army on the Prussian frontier.</p>
			<p>Nicholas looked over the list and struck out some names; and then briefly and firmly gave orders to move two divisions to the Prussian frontier. Nicholas could not forgive the King of Prussia for granting a Constitution to his people after the events of 1848, and therefore, while expressing most friendly feelings to his brother-in-law in letters and conversation, he considered it necessary to keep an army near the frontier in case of need. He might want to use these troops to defend his brother-in-law’s throne if the people of Prussia rebelled (Nicholas saw a readiness for rebellion everywhere) as he had used troops to suppress the rising in Hungary a few years previously. They were also of use to give more weight and influence to such advice as he gave to the King of Prussia.</p>
			<p>“Yes⁠—what would Russia be like now if it were not for me?” he again thought.</p>
			<p>“Well, what else is there?” said he.</p>
			<p>“A courier from the Caucasus,” said Chernyshóv, and he reported what Vorontsóv had written about Hadji Murád’s surrender.</p>
			<p>“Dear me!” said Nicholas. “Well, it’s a good beginning!”</p>
			<p>“Evidently the plan devised by your Majesty begins to bear fruit,” said Chernyshóv.</p>
			<p>This approval of his strategic talents was particularly pleasant to Nicholas because, though he prided himself upon those talents, at the bottom of his heart he knew that they did not really exist; and he now desired to hear more detailed praise of himself.</p>
			<p>“How do you mean?” he asked.</p>
			<p>“I understand it this way⁠—that if your Majesty’s plans had been adopted long ago, and we had moved forward steadily though slowly, cutting down forests and destroying the supplies of food, the Caucasus would have been subjugated long ago. I attribute Hadji Murád’s surrender entirely to his having come to the conclusion that they can hold out no longer.”</p>
			<p>“True,” said Nicholas.</p>
			<p>Although the plan of a gradual advance into the enemy’s territory by means of felling forests and destroying the food supplies was Ermolóv’s and Velyamínov’s plan, and was quite contrary to Nicholas’s own plan of seizing Shamil’s place of residence and destroying that nest of robbers⁠—which was the plan on which the dargo expedition in 1845 (that cost so many lives) had been undertaken⁠—Nicholas nevertheless attributed to himself also the plan of a slow advance and a systematic felling of forests and devastation of the country. It would seem that to believe the plan of a slow movement by felling forests and destroying food supplies was his own, necessitated the hiding the fact that he had insisted on quite contrary operations in 1845. But he did not hide it, and was proud of the plan of the 1845 expedition, and also of the plan of a slow advance⁠—though the two were obviously contrary to one another. Continual brazen flattery from everybody round him in the teeth of obvious facts, had brought him to such a state that he no longer saw his own inconsistencies or measured his actions and words by reality, logic, or even simple common sense; but was quite convinced that all his orders, however senseless, unjust, and mutually contradictory they might be, became reasonable, just, and mutually accordant simply because he gave them. His decision in the case next reported to him⁠—that of the student of the Academy of Medicine⁠—was of that senseless kind.</p>
			<p>The case was as follows: A young man who had twice failed in his examinations was being examined a third time, and when the examiner again would not pass him, the young man, whose nerves were deranged, considering this to be an injustice, in a paroxysm of fury seized a penknife from the table and, rushing at the professor, inflicted on him several trifling wounds.</p>
			<p>“What’s his name?” asked Nicholas.</p>
			<p>“Bzhezóvski.”</p>
			<p>“A Pole?”</p>
			<p>“Of Polish descent and a Roman Catholic,” answered Chernyshóv.</p>
			<p>Nicholas frowned. He had done much evil to the Poles. To justify that evil he had to feel certain that all Poles were rascals, and hated them accordingly in proportion to the evil he had done to them.</p>
			<p>“Wait a little,” he said, closing his eyes and bowing his head.</p>
			<p>Chernyshóv, having more than once heard Nicholas say so, knew that when the Emperor had to take a decision, it was only necessary for him to concentrate his attention for a few moments, and the spirit moved him, and the best possible decision presented itself, as though an inner voice had told him what to do. He was now thinking how most fully to satisfy the feeling of hatred against the Poles which this incident had stirred up within him; and the inner voice suggested the following decision. He took the report and in his large handwriting wrote on its margin with three orthographical mistakes:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p><!--Sic-->“Diserves deth, but, thank God, we have no capitle punishment, and it is not for me to introduce it. Make him run the gauntlet of a thousand men twelve times. <span epub:type="z3998:signature">—Nicholas</span>.”</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>He signed, adding his unnaturally huge flourish.</p>
			<p>Nicholas knew that twelve thousand strokes with the regulation rods were not only certain death with torture, but were a superfluous cruelty, for five thousand strokes were sufficient to kill the strongest man. But it pleased him to be ruthlessly cruel, and it also pleased him to think that we have abolished capital punishment in Russia.</p>
			<p>Having written his decision about the student, he pushed it across to Chernyshóv.</p>
			<p>“There,” he said, “read it.”</p>
			<p>Chernyshóv read it, and bowed his head as a sign of respectful amazement at the wisdom of the decision.</p>
			<p>“Yes, and let all the students be present on the drill-ground at the punishment,” added Nicholas.</p>
			<p>“It will do them good! I will abolish this revolutionary spirit, and will tear it up by the roots!” he thought.</p>
			<p>“It shall be done,” replied Chernyshóv; and after a short pause he straightened the tuft on his forehead and returned to the Caucasian report.</p>
			<p>“What do you command me to write in reply to Prince Vorontsóv’s dispatch?”</p>
			<p>“To keep firmly to my system of destroying the dwellings and food supplies in Chechnya, and to harass them by raids.” answered Nicholas.</p>
			<p>“And what are your Majesty’s commands with reference to Hadji Murád?” asked Chernyshóv.</p>
			<p>“Well, Vorontsóv writes that he wants to make use of him in the Caucasus.”</p>
			<p>“Is it not dangerous?” said Chernyshóv, avoiding Nicholas’s gaze. “Prince Vorontsóv is, I’m afraid, too confiding.”</p>
			<p>“And you⁠—what do you think?” asked Nicholas sharply, detecting Chernyshóv’s intention of presenting Vorontsóv’s decision in an unfavorable light.</p>
			<p>“Well, I should have thought it would be safer to deport him to Central Russia.”</p>
			<p>“You would have thought!” said Nicholas ironically. “But I don’t think so, and agree with Vorontsóv. Write to him accordingly.”</p>
			<p>“It shall be done,” said Chernyshóv, rising and bowing himself out.</p>
			<p>Dolgorúky also bowed himself out, having during the whole audience only uttered a few words (in reply to a question from Nicholas) about the movement of the army.</p>
			<p>After Chernyshóv, Nicholas received Bíbikov, General-Governor of the Western Provinces. Having expressed his approval of the measures taken by Bíbikov against the mutinous peasants who did not wish to accept the orthodox Faith, he ordered him to have all those who did not submit tried by court-martial. That was equivalent to sentencing them to run the gauntlet. He also ordered the editor of a newspaper to be sent to serve in the ranks of the army for publishing information about the transfer of several thousand State peasants to the imperial estates.</p>
			<p>“I do this because I consider it necessary,” said Nicholas, “and I will not allow it to be discussed.”</p>
			<p>Bíbikov saw the cruelty of the order concerning the Uniate<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-36" id="noteref-36" epub:type="noteref">36</a> peasants, and the injustice of transferring State peasants (the only free peasants in Russia in those days) to the Crown, which meant making them serfs of the Imperial family. But it was impossible to express dissent. Not to agree with Nicholas’s decisions would have meant the loss of that brilliant position which it had cost Bíbikov forty years to attain and which he now enjoyed; and he therefore submissively bowed his dark head (already touched with grey) to indicate his submission and his readiness to fulfil the cruel, insensate, and dishonest supreme will.</p>
			<p>Having dismissed Bíbikov, Nicholas, with a sense of duty well fulfilled, stretched himself, glanced at the clock, and went to get ready to go out. Having put on a uniform with epaulets, orders, and a ribbon, he went out into the reception hall, where more than a hundred persons⁠—men in uniforms and women in elegant low-necked dresses, all standing in the places assigned to them⁠—awaited his arrival with agitation.</p>
			<p>He came out to them with a lifeless look in his eyes, his chest expanded, his stomach bulging out above and below its bandages; and feeling everybody’s gaze tremulously and obsequiously fixed upon him, he assumed an even more triumphant air. When his eyes met those of people he knew, remembering who was who, he stopped and addressed a few words to them, sometimes in Russian and sometimes in French, and transfixing them with his cold glassy eye, listened to what they said.</p>
			<p>Having received all the New Year congratulations, he passed on to church, where God, through His servants the priests, greeted and praised Nicholas just as worldly people did; and weary as he was of these greetings and praises, Nicholas duly accepted them. All this was as it should be, because the welfare and happiness of the whole world depended on him; and though the matter wearied him, he still did not refuse the universe his assistance.</p>
			<p>When at the end of the service the magnificently arrayed deacon, his long hair crimped and carefully combed, began the chant “Many Years,” which was heartily caught up by the splendid choir, Nicholas looked round and noticed Nelídova, with her fine shoulders, standing by a window, and he decided the comparison with yesterday’s girl in her favor.</p>
			<p>After Mass he went to the Empress and spent a few minutes in the bosom of his family, joking with the children and his wife. Then, passing through the Hermitage,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-37" id="noteref-37" epub:type="noteref">37</a> he visited the Minister of the Court, Volkónski, and among other things ordered him to pay out of a special fund a yearly pension to the mother of yesterday’s girl. From there he went for his customary drive.</p>
			<p>Dinner that day was served in the Pompeian Hall. Besides the younger sons of Nicholas and Michael, there were also invited Baron Lieven, Count Rjévski, Dolgorúky, the Prussian Ambassador, and the King of Prussia’s aide-de-camp.</p>
			<p>While waiting for the appearance of the Emperor and Empress, an interesting conversation took place between Baron Lieven and the Prussian Ambassador concerning the disquieting news from Poland.</p>
			<p>“<i xml:lang="fr">La Pologne et le Caucases, ce sont les deux cautères de la Russie</i>,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-38" id="noteref-38" epub:type="noteref">38</a> said Lieven. “<i xml:lang="fr">Il nous faut dent mille hommes à peu près, dans chaqu’un de ces deux pays.</i>”</p>
			<p>The Ambassador expressed a fictitious surprise that it should be so.</p>
			<p>“<i xml:lang="fr">Vous dites, la Pologne⁠—</i>”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-39" id="noteref-39" epub:type="noteref">39</a> began the Ambassador.</p>
			<p>“<i xml:lang="fr">Oh, oui, c’était un coup de maître de Metternich, de nous en avoir laissé l’embarras.⁠ ⁠…</i>”</p>
			<p>At this point the Empress, with her trembling head and fixed smile, entered followed by Nicholas.</p>
			<p>At dinner Nicholas spoke of Hadji Murád’s surrender, and said that the war in the Caucasus must now soon come to an end in consequence of the measures he was taking to limit the scope of the mountaineers, by felling their forests and by his system of erecting a series of small forts.</p>
			<p>The Ambassador, having exchanged a rapid glance with the aide-de-camp⁠—to whom he had only that morning spoken about Nicholas’s unfortunate weakness for considering himself a great strategist⁠—warmly praised this plan, which once more demonstrated Nicholas’s great strategic ability.</p>
			<p>After dinner Nicholas drove to the ballet, where hundreds of women marched round in tights and scanty clothing. One of them specially attracted him, and he had the German ballet-master sent for, and gave orders that a diamond ring should be presented to her.</p>
			<p>The next day, when Chernyshóv came with his report, Nicholas again confirmed his order to Vorontsóv⁠—that now that Hadji Murád had surrendered, the Chechens should be more actively harassed than ever, and the cordon round them tightened.</p>
			<p>Chernyshóv wrote in that sense to Vorontsóv; and another courier, overdriving more horses and bruising the faces of more drivers, galloped to Tiflis.</p>
